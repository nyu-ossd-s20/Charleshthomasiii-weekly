title: Week 1: Completely Unsubstantiated Opinionated Thoughts on Open Source
---

For me, the words open source appear most often when looking for a solution. Some recent examples include: a new e-reader, converting mobi files to epub, and building a new keyboard. Whenever there is a software problem, there is often a _for-profit proprietary solution_ and an _not-for-profit open source solution_. There can be one FOSS and one proprietary, many FOSS and many proprietary, and everything in between. For example, photo editing has (effectively) only GIMP vs Photoshop. Linux (and it's flavors) vs Windows/MacOS. Textmate/Sublimtext vs VIM/VScode/Atom/etc.

The success of open source and close source depends on the type of problem that needs to be solved. In general, it seems that open source wins out in three problem categories:

1. Things that don't make money.
2. Things that software developers use.
3. Things that can't be trusted. (often overlaps with 2)

Commonly there is an open source solution for a problem, but it doesn't meet the standards of the closed source solution. For example, GIMP has nowhere near the same capability as photoshop to be seriously considered for a professional. The same applies to Digital Audio Workstations (Ableton, Logic, FLstudio, Pro tools) vs Ardour/Audacity. No music professional will use an open source solution for working with sound. This phenomenon plays out in all media, especially anything that Adobe Suite does. Fundamentally, it seems that open source solutions exist when there is _not_ swaths of professionals willing to pay a premium for a high quality product. However, this does not seem to be the case when those professionals have the ability to create their own software, as with software developers who congregate around open source solutions to produce software.

Open source solutions win out when there is little room to turn a profit via selling the software itself. These problems include things like converting filetypes, video playback, and internet browsers. For example, there is no way anyone would ever buy video playback software. MacOS and Windows default media players do the job just fine, and there is no incentive for Apple or Microsoft developers to make a large featureset for these players, so VLC is a vastly improved user experience than any propriety solution, precisely because there is no way to get people to buy it.

The last common use case of open source software are things that can't be trusted. The most prominent use case are cryptocurrencies. These extend the principles of open source to the logical extreme: trust no-one and computationally compete for digital currency.

When talking about the advantages of open source, the most common response is that the user can make changes to the source code to suit their own needs. I believe this is actually *totally*, *absolutely*, *completely* the wrong response. I would wager that less than one percent of users actually look at the source code, and an even smaller percent of those people attempt to make changes to it. If I were to try to convince someone to use Libreoffice to write an essay _because they can change the source code_ nobody would ever use it.

projects: 

briefly talk about four open source projects that you regularly use or that influenced you in some way in the past (note, the projects do not have to be source code based) (Keep in mind that these blogs are publicly available to anybody who stumbles upon them. Make sure that the posts are appropriate.)
