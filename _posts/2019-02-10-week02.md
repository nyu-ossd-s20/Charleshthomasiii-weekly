title: (Week 2) Nickelodeon and NYU team up and sue Nishant Amad and Charlie for Copyright Infringement
---

Our group creatd Mockbob. It replaces normal text with spONgeBoB mOCkiNG tExT, deepfries images, and changes the font of a webpage. All p, a, and h tags that contain the chosen text are replaced. If the user doesn't specify text, it defaults to 'NYU' and 'New York University'. Working as a group was easy: we created a repo, uploaded some code, then worked until it was finished. The work was distributed well, I mostly did the the javascript, Nishant worked on the graphics/css/html, and Amad worked on the github. There was little code overlap.
      
I learned how successful a group can be with effective distrubution of labor. Each person's contribution was high quality work,  so there was no need to spend time working on another's contribution. 

I learned more about javascript, regex, and manipulating images with css. I realized I work well when there's nobody checking my work, because if it breaks it's all on me. I didn't do much at all to manipulate how the page looked; Nishant did a great job on _aesthetics_. Nishant showed me ubuntu workspace hotkeys, so that was cool to learn.
